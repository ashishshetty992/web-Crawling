# web-Crawling

1. We should be able to implement it in a couple of hours.
2. Efficiency / Parallelism is useful but not required right now. Would be ideal if we can ignore this for now but we can leave space to accommodate such an extension in the future
3. It should leave scope for us to extend the functionality of the system to various use cases like treating urls, files, videos etc differently as the complexity of the system increases
4. It should allow us to constrain the scope of the crawl to a limited set of domains
5. The code should be easy to understand for new developers who may not have access to you to ask questions.

TBD
